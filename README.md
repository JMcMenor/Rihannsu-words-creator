====================================

Executable file Rihannsu.exe it is
a self-extracting SFX archive
containing six files:


insignia.ico

insignia.png

php.exe

php8ts.dll

rihannsu.php

run.bat


The assembly works due to the presence,
in fact, of an adapted script in PHP, taken
from website http://www.rihannsu.org/tools/gen.txt,
the official PHP interpreter and its dynamic link library.

The archive is configured to decompress itself into
a temporary folder. Upon completion of unpacking,
the bat script will be called, which will
configure the console window settings
and run the php script through the
interpreter with output to the
standard Windows console.

This ensures full compatibility
with all versions of Windows. In the
Sources folder, you can find, examine, and
manually try all the components of the assembly.
If something is damaged, it doesn't matter. Just unzip
the archive manually using WinRAR, there are exactly the same files.

And in a simple way, just run Rihannsu.exe, the magic will happen by itself!)

Sincerely yours,

Julian Mc-Menor
